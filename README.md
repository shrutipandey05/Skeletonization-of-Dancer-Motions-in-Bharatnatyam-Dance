# Skeletonization-of-Dancer-Motions-in-Bharatnatyam-Dance
In order to obtain the skeleton of Bharatnatyam dancers, the following solutions
are proposed:


• The original U-Net architecture’s encoder and decoder components were modi-
fied using the attention mechanism to improve their respective capabilities for
feature reconstruction and representation. 

• A two-stage version of the well-known U-Net architecture that divides the problem space into two smaller issues, corrective skeleton thinning and shape mini-
mization. 

• Advancements made in Single-network architectures for whole-body skeletoniza-
tion
